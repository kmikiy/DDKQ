## How to Build

First, you'll need Xcode 8. You can download this at the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
Second, you'll need [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). 

Now, use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kmikiy/DDKQ.git
cd DDKQ
pod install
```

Finally, open up the DDKQ.xcworkspace. Set the "Scheme" to build the "DDKQ" target for "My Mac". Then Product > Run (or the shortcut ⌘R).
